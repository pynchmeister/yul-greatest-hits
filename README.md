# yul-greatest-hits
A collection of my work done in Yul/Yul+ from basic token standards, to advanced Defi primitives

## Background

Yul (previously also called JULIA or IULIA) is an intermediate language that can be compiled to bytecode for different backends.

Yul is a good target for high-level optimisation stages that can benefit all target platforms equally.
